# Danger zone: exploring associations among crime and urban characteristics in Chicago 

This project was done as a seminar work for "Seminar Geodata Analysis and Modelling" at the Institute of Geography, University of Bern.

# Purposes of research
  - &#9745; Collect and pre-process relevant dataset in Chicago.   
  - &#9745; Implement the algorithmic logics (Twinam, 2017) .  
  - &#9745; Explore the association among crime and other characteristics in Chicago.  

# Methods and datasets
- Algorithms and implements:   
  &#9745; Centrality   
  &#9745; Points in Circle   
  &#9745; Points in Polygon   
  &#9745; Spatial index   
  &#9745; Correlation analysis   

  This project use python to finish analysis process. First of all, I build up the module for accelerated processing interaction points in traffic networks. As for process part, this part is relying on the 'json', 'math', 'Shapely', 'Numpy' packages. In the end, for analyses part, relying on the 'Pandas', 'Numpy', 'Geopandas', 'matplotlib', 'time' packages.  

- Datasets:
  - &#9745; Crime dataset from 2001 to 2018 in Chicago  
  - &#9745; Commerical land use (e.g. restaurants and shops) from OpenStreetMap  
  - &#9745; Street weights (i.e. the combination between density and class) from Chicago  
  - &#9745; Population density of 2018 from Chicago
