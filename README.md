# Associations among crime and urban characteristics in Chicago 

This project was done as a seminar work for "Seminar Geodata Analysis and Modelling" at the University of Bern, during the spring semester of 2021.

# Purposes of research
&#9744; Collect and pre-process relevant dataset in Chicago.   
&#9744; Implement the algorithmic logic (Twinam, 2017) .  
&#9744; Explore the association among crime and other characteristics in Chicago.  
 
# Programming Language Details
This project use python to finish analysis process.   
First of all, I build up the module for accelerated processing interaction points in traffic networks.   
As for process part, this part is relying on the 'json', 'math', 'Shapely', 'Numpy' packages.  
In the end, for analyses part, relying on the 'Pandas', 'Numpy', 'Geopandas', 'matplotlib', 'time' packages.
